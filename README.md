# Edge-Final-Project
# My idea of my project is to create a game of Hangman. Where the user will have 6 tries to guess a word that is chosen randomly. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes. If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the it will appear in the correct position where it exists.  An image of the actual hangman will be printed whenever the user gets an answer wrong to show the have many tries are left
